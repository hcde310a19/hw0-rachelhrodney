# Description of your program (part 7)

To count the number of words in a document,
start your count at 1, then for each empty
space in the file which is followed by another
word, add +1 to your current count.



# Reflection on writing your program (part 8)

This description was easy for me to write, but
I have not tested it on anyone besides in my
head. But I think it makes sense, and makes
accomodations for potential fence posting?
In this course I hope to get patience when dealing
with programming.
